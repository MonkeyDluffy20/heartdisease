## Overview

This repository provides a machine-learning solution for predicting heart disease based on patient data. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training using logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier, as well as evaluating model performance.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

## Dataset

The dataset (`Heart Disease.csv`) contains patient data attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. The target variable indicates whether the patient has heart disease or not.

## Usage

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predict-heart-disease.git
   cd predict-heart-disease

Models
Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as heart disease in this case.

Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Tree classifier splits the dataset into subsets based on conditions that maximize the information gain.

Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest classifier builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
